[0.00 - 5.00] I have the pleasure to present to present to you Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
[13.00 - 24.00] I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest
[24.00 - 28.00] demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
[28.00 - 40.00] Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today,
[40.00 - 55.64] ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation.
[55.64 - 65.52] This momentous decree came, as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had
[65.52 - 76.68] been seared in the flames of withering injustice to us. It came as a joyous day break to end the
[76.68 - 93.32] long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro steel is not free. One hundred
[93.32 - 104.10] years later. The life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and
[104.10 - 112.84] the chains of discrimination one hundred years later. The Negro lives on a lonely island
[112.84 - 119.84] a poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity 100 years later.
[119.84 - 121.84] One hundred years later.
[121.84 - 135.32] The Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in his own
[135.32 - 136.32] land.
[136.32 - 144.96] And so we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
[144.96 - 151.64] In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check.
[151.64 - 159.72] the architects of our republic, wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the declaration
[159.72 - 171.24] of independence. They were signing a promise or a note to whichever American was to fall out.
[171.24 - 174.92] This note was a promise at all men.
[174.92 - 184.92] Yes, black men as well as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty
[184.92 - 193.76] and a pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this
[193.76 - 202.48] promise or enough in so far as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring
[202.48 - 209.48] this sacred obligation. America has given the Negro people a bad check.
[209.48 - 213.48] a check which has come back mark insufficient fund.
[213.48 - 235.04] But we refuse to believe that the Bank of Justice is bankrupt.
[235.04 - 240.48] We refuse to believe that that that our insufficient funds and the great folks of opportunity
[240.48 - 247.16] of this nation. So we've come to cash this check or check that will give us upon demand the
[247.16 - 261.02] the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
[261.02 - 272.20] We have also come to this hell of spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.
[272.20 - 280.40] This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of
[280.40 - 297.66] gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time the rise from the
[297.66 - 303.66] dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.
[303.66 - 304.66] Now is the time.
[304.66 - 315.66] to lift our nation from the quick sends of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
[315.66 - 317.66] Now is the time.
[317.66 - 323.66] May justice and justice and reality for all of God's children.
[323.66 - 330.66] It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment,
[330.66 - 336.66] this sweltering summering summer of the Negroes legitimate discontent
[336.66 - 343.66] will not pass until that is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality.
[343.66 - 355.50] 1963, 1963 is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam
[355.50 - 361.80] and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business
[361.80 - 368.80] as usual.
[368.80 - 385.00] And now will be neither rest nor tranquillity in America until the Negro has granted his citizenship
[385.00 - 392.00] rights. The world wins the revolt will continue to shape the foundations of our nation until
[392.00 - 396.00] until the bright day of justice emerges.
[396.00 - 400.00] But that is something that I must say to my people,
[400.00 - 407.00] who stand on the wrong threshold which leads into the palace of justice,
[407.00 - 411.00] and the process of gaining our rightful place.
[411.00 - 416.00] We must not be guilty of wrongful deeds.
[416.00 - 425.00] Let us not seek the same far first of freedom by drinking from the couple of sins and hatred.
[430.00 - 439.00] We must now have the last struggle on the high training of picnic and discipline.
[439.00 - 446.00] We must not allow our creative protest to generate into physical violence.
[446.00 - 456.00] We have gained on a game, we have rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force for so far.
[456.00 - 464.00] The Marvelous new militants say, which has in dark the Negro community, must not lead us to
[464.00 - 467.40] is just a whole white people. We're made our white
[467.40 - 470.40] as ever this by that presidency of today.
[470.40 - 477.40] Now, from to realize that that they have to have a life.
[477.40 - 488.40] They have come to realize that freedom is in a strictly
[488.40 - 490.40] We cannot walk alone.
[490.40 - 493.90] We cannot walk alone.
[493.90 - 505.90] As we want. We must make the plans that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.
[505.90 - 509.90] Now those who are asking the devotees of civil rights.
[509.90 - 513.90] When will you be satisfied this time?
[513.90 - 518.94] We can never be satisfied as far as long as the new colors of the great picture of all the
[518.94 - 522.24] own beautiful hours of police brutality.
[522.24 - 528.18] We can never be satisfied as far as long as our body and
[528.18 - 530.18] with a contingent, with a particular travel.
[530.18 - 533.22] They're not getting larger in the more
[533.22 - 535.22] to the highways and the whole
[535.22 - 536.22] to the city.
[536.22 - 544.22] We cannot be satisfied
[544.22 - 551.22] fight as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing
[551.22 - 565.30] for which to vote. No, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied
[565.30 - 572.30] be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty street.
[581.30 - 591.30] I am not mindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulation.
[591.30 - 598.30] Some of you have come fresh from now, a jail sale.
[598.30 - 602.50] Some of you have come from areas where your press quest quest for freedom
[602.50 - 610.34] left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of
[610.34 - 615.42] police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering.
[615.42 - 623.86] Continue to work with the faith that online suffering is
[623.86 - 632.56] redemptive. Go back to Mississippi. go back to Alabama go back to South Carolina go back to Georgia
[632.56 - 639.08] go back to Louisiana go back to the slums and get holes of our northern cities.
[639.08 - 645.60] knowing that somehow this situation can and will be change.
[645.60 - 662.60] Let us not Walla in the Valley of despair. I say to you today my friend.
[662.60 - 673.44] So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.
[673.44 - 678.16] It is a dream deeply rooted deeply rooted in the American dream.
[678.16 - 688.88] I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
[688.88 - 695.88] We hold these tools to be self-evident that all men are created equal.
[695.88 - 715.98] I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of
[715.98 - 722.78] former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
[722.78 - 734.76] I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state, sweltering with the heat of
[734.76 - 741.84] the heat of the injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into
[741.84 - 745.84] and oasis of freedom and justice as I have a dream.
[745.84 - 758.84] But my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[758.84 - 761.84] character. I have a dream to be.
[761.84 - 768.84] I have a dream that one day.
[768.84 - 775.84] I have a dream that one day.
[775.84 - 780.84] in Alabama with its vicious racist racist racist governor
[780.84 - 785.84] with its governor having his lips tripping with the words of interposition and
[785.84 - 791.84] nullification. One day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls
[791.84 - 795.48] will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls
[795.48 - 809.16] girls, sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every
[809.16 - 815.56] Valerates shall be exalted never heal in mounting shall be made low the rough places will be made
[815.56 - 822.60] made and the crooked places will be made straight and the go of the Lord shall be revealed in all flesh shall
[822.60 - 831.08] See it together this is I hope this is a faith that I go back to the south with with with this faith
[831.08 - 836.08] We will be able to hue out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.
[836.08 - 843.08] With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful,
[843.08 - 855.08] symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together to work together to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together to stand up for freedom together
[855.08 - 862.92] stand up for freedom together knowing that we will be free one day. This will be the day.
[862.92 - 867.92] This will be the day with all of God's children.
[867.92 - 868.92] Yes.
[868.92 - 876.92] And be able to sing with new meaning my country tears of the sweet land of liberty of the I sing.
[876.92 - 881.92] Land where my father's died land of the pilgrim's pride.
[881.92 - 884.92] From every mountain side.
[884.92 - 888.92] Let freedom ring in America to be a great nation.
[888.92 - 890.92] This must become true.
[890.92 - 892.92] So let freedom ring.
[892.92 - 895.92] from the prodigious hill tops of New Hampshire.
[895.92 - 900.92] Let Freedom Rain from the mighty mountains of New York
[900.92 - 905.92] let Freedom Rain from the heightening alligators of Pennsylvania.
[905.92 - 909.92] Let Freedom Ring from the snow cap Rockers of Colorado.
[909.92 - 914.92] Let freedom ring from the crevace of slopes of California.
[914.92 - 921.92] But not only that, let freedom reign from stone mountain of Georgia.
[921.92 - 929.92] Let freedom reign from mountain of Tennessee, let freedom reign from every hill and
[929.92 - 939.92] and whole hill of Mississippi, from every mountain side, let freedom reign and when this happens.
[939.92 - 946.42] When we allow freedom of the ring, when we let it ring from every village and
[946.42 - 954.10] ever hamlet from every state and every city. We will be able to speed up that day up
[954.10 - 957.80] When all of God's children, children, black men and white men,
[957.80 - 966.80] Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, and will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual.
[966.80 - 972.80] Three at last, last, three at last, take God Almighty, we are three at last.
[984.10 - 986.10] Thank you.
